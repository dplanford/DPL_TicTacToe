# DPL_TicTacToe
A quicky Tic-Tac-Toe game I built for a coding test for Level 11. It got me the job!

Someday I might finish it... it all works, and the algorithm for checking the board for a win is scaleable.

But I never implemented the classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe algorithm out on the internet, and never hooked up the easy/hard options slider to control how often the computer chose randomly/algorithmically.
